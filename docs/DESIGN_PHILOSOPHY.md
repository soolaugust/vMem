# Design Philosophy — OS / cognitive primitives behind vMem

> Every subsystem in vMem maps onto a known mechanism — most from the
> Linux kernel, some from cognitive science. This page is the full mapping,
> mainly for contributors and curious readers. The README only lists the
> top-level metaphor; the table below is the "long form."

The iteration numbers (`iter N`) point at the commit where each mechanism
landed, so you can `git log --grep="iter N"` to see the actual change.

## Cognitive-science primitives

A handful of subsystems borrow from human-memory research where the OS
analogue ran out. These tend to govern *retrieval-quality* decisions
(which item to surface) rather than *resource-management* decisions (when
to evict).

|---|---|---|
| Session episode timeline | Hippocampal sequential replay | iter 364 |

| Spacing-effect scheduler | Ebbinghaus forgetting curve | iter 383 |
| Inhibition of return (IOR) | Posner (1980) attention shift | iter 391 |

| Second-chance diversity sampling | Clock page replacement | iter 471 |
| Token-budget aware truncation | Memory pressure tiering | iter 474 |

## Why this matters

The point of the OS analogy isn't decoration. Operating systems solved an
isomorphic class of problems decades ago — limited fast storage, unlimited
slow storage, multiple concurrent consumers, predictable behavior under
pressure. We get to skip forty years of design exploration by reusing the
right primitive instead of inventing a new one.

When you read this list, the mental shift is: every row is a *named tool*
with known semantics. "Page fault" already tells you what should happen
on a miss. "mlock" already tells you what cannot be evicted. The job of
vMem is just to keep that mapping honest.
