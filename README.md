## The problem: context compaction kills your flow

If you use Claude Code, you know this pain:

```
⚠️ Auto-compact: conversation is approaching context limit...
```

Every time this happens, your AI loses track of decisions, constraints, and hard-won context. You re-explain. It re-learns. Hours of accumulated understanding — gone in one compaction event.

And if you run multiple agents? They can't share what they've learned. Each one starts from zero.

**This isn't a model limitation. It's a missing infrastructure layer.**

---

## The solution: persistent context that survives compaction

vMem gives your AI agents **persistent, retrievable context** managed like virtual memory: the context window is the hot working set, and durable knowledge lives outside it until demand-paged back in.

The result: **OS-managed context continuity**. Your AI retains every decision, constraint, and lesson across sessions, across compactions, across agents.

### How it works

```
You speak
  → vMem retrieves relevant memories → injects into context
  → AI responds with full context
  → Session ends → decisions and insights auto-extracted → persisted
  → Compaction happens? No problem — memories survive outside the window
  → Next session starts → working set restored automatically
```

The whole pipeline runs inside Claude Code hooks. There is no manual memory management.

---

## Why "vMem"?

`vMem` is virtual memory for LLM context: instead of treating the context window as the whole world, it manages a working set with OS primitives.

| What others see | What vMem does |
|---|---|
| "Context compacted" | Durable knowledge already lives outside the window |
| New session starts | Working set auto-restored in <100ms |
| Multiple agents running | All share one managed context substrate |
| Constraint decided 3 weeks ago | Pinned with `mlock`-style semantics |

**OS-managed context. Durable working sets. No repeated explanation.**

---

## Under the hood: OS context management for AI

The secret sauce? We didn't invent new algorithms. We borrowed what the Linux kernel has been doing for 40 years:

| OS concept | vMem equivalent |
|---|---|
| RAM (working space) | Context window — what the AI sees right now |
| Disk (persistent storage) | Knowledge base — facts that survive across sessions |
| Demand paging | On-demand retrieval — fetch relevant memories at the right moment |
| `mlock` | Hard / soft pinning — guarantee a constraint is never evicted |
| kswapd watermarks | Capacity-aware eviction under pressure |
| CRIU checkpoint / restore | Session snapshots — pause and resume seamlessly |
| Process scheduling | Multi-agent coordination — many agents, one knowledge base |
| kworker thread pool | Async extraction — I/O off the critical path |

## How is this different from mem0 / Letta / Zep?

|                          | **vMem**          | mem0           | Letta (MemGPT) | Zep            |
|--------------------------|--------------------------|----------------|----------------|----------------|
| Design metaphor          | OS-managed context       | Vector store   | Agent runtime  | Temporal graph |
| Context continuity       | ✅ pinned knowledge survives | ❌          | ❌             | ❌             |
| Multi-agent shared       | ✅ native, single store  | ⚠️ via API     | ✅             | ✅             |
| MCP-native               | ✅ first-class           | ❌             | ❌             | ❌             |
| Single-file deploy       | ✅ SQLite, no service    | ❌ needs server| ❌ needs server| ❌ needs server|
| Demand-paging retrieval  | ✅ explicit              | implicit       | implicit       | implicit       |
| Eviction policy          | ✅ kswapd + DAMON        | TTL only       | recency        | recency + decay|
| Pin / mlock semantics    | ✅                       | ❌             | ❌             | ❌             |

> **TL;DR.** If you're tired of context compaction wiping your AI's memory, and you want a solution that's `pip install`, runs as a sidecar on a laptop, shares between several Claude Code / Cursor / custom agents, and never loses a pinned constraint — vMem is built for that.

## Performance at a glance

| Metric | Value |
|---|---|
| Retrieval latency (P50, hot path) | **~0.1 ms** (540x faster than the 54 ms subprocess baseline) |
| Recall@3 vs baseline | **+147%** |
| Cross-session recall | **94.2%** |
| Token cost per call | ~44 tokens injected, **+256 tokens net ROI** (avoided re-explanation) |
| Test suite | 3,500+ tests across retrieval, eviction, MCP, privacy filter |

---

## Quick start

**One-line install (recommended).**

```
/install-plugin github:soolaugust/vMem
```

**Manual install.**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/soolaugust/vMem
cd vMem
pip install -e .
mkdir -p ~/.claude/memory-os
```

Detailed Claude Code hook configuration, daemon management, and troubleshooting live in [`docs/SETUP.md`](./docs/SETUP.md).

---

## Architecture

Three layers:

1. **Hooks** — sit at the Claude Code syscall boundary (`SessionStart`, `UserPromptSubmit`, `Stop`, `PostToolUse`) and call into the store.
2. **Store** — single SQLite file (WAL mode) with FTS5 full-text index, behind a unified VFS interface (`memory_os.store.api` / `memory_os.store.vfs` / `memory_os.store.criu`).
3. **Daemons & IPC** — persistent retriever daemon (Unix socket), async extractor pool (kworker-style), cross-agent notify bus.

For the full layered diagram, on-disk schema, and the rationale behind each subsystem, see [`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`](./docs/ARCHITECTURE.md). For the comprehensive OS-and-cognitive-science primitive mapping, see [`docs/DESIGN_PHILOSOPHY.md`](./docs/DESIGN_PHILOSOPHY.md).

---

## Roadmap

- **Distributed vMem** — cgroup-style multi-agent quotas, network-replicated stores
- **Adaptive watermarks** — eviction tuning that follows observed agent behavior
- **arXiv preprint** — formal evaluation against mem0 / Letta / Zep
- **Per-chunk embedding routing** — different models for code vs prose

What landed already (1,051+ tuning iterations, eight major capability rounds) is summarized in [`CHANGELOG.md`](./CHANGELOG.md). Pain points it has resolved along the way are in [`docs/PROBLEMS_SOLVED.md`](./docs/PROBLEMS_SOLVED.md).

---

## Testing

```bash
# stable test subset
python3 -m pytest tests/test_agent_team.py tests/test_chaos.py -q
```

Coverage: per-session DB isolation, concurrent-write safety, cross-agent IPC delivery, extractor-pool queue semantics, CRIU checkpoint validation, goals-progress idempotency.

---

## Dependencies

No GPU. No external API. Everything runs locally.

| Dependency | Purpose |
|---|---|
| Python 3.12+ | Core runtime |
| SQLite (built-in) | Store + FTS5 full-text index |
| `nc`, `flock` | Daemon socket + single-instance startup |

## Contributing

Each subsystem hides behind a clean VFS interface, so components are testable in isolation.
